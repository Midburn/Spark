# Spark by Midburn

Spark is a system of services that help facilitate & run a burn event throughout the year. It contains:
- Profiles
- Ticketing
- Theme Camps & Art
- Static Content
- ... ?

It does ***not*** contain Ticket Queue Management, which is handled by a separate system).

Spark is being developed by the Midburn IT team, with the purpose of utilizing it to run Midburn 2017, and in the future other regional events.

## Installation

### Preconditions
>1. **NodeJS** ( https://nodejs.org/en/ ) (use latest version 6.9+, we use ECMAScript 2015)
>2. **mySQL** ( http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ )
>3. **GIT** ( https://git-scm.com/downloads )

### MYSQL Preconditions
On Mac after installing, please add the following lines to your ~/.bash_profile
```
$ alias mysql=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
$ alias mysqladmin=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin
```

Also, On first install, you might get mysql password expired or other root password related issues.

To change mysql default password - run the following commands
```
mysql -u root -p
```
Enter the default root password you got during mysql setup
Then run the following to set your password:
```
SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('xxxxxxxx');
```

### Getting the source files
* Fork the project on GitHub
* make dir & clone the repo
```
$ mkdir spark && git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USER>/Spark.git
```

**OR** (For GUEST access)
```
$ mkdir spark && git clone https://github.com/Midburn/Spark.git
```

### Installing node modules
`$ cd spark && npm install`

### Setting up the database
1. To create the database for the first time, run:
```
$ mysql -u root -p < sql/create_db.sql
```

2. To create the database schema:
```
$ mysql -u root -p < migrations/create_db.sql
$ npm install -g knex
$ knex migrate:latest
```


## Light the spark
Fire up the server after installation

`$ node start`

and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

**Note** You probably want the server to automatically detect your edits, instead of restarting it all the time.
If so run once `npm install -g nodemon` and then use `nodemon start` to run the server instead of using `node start`

### Creating an admin account
After lighting the spark, if this is the first time or if you have recreated the DB, browse to the development console at http://localhost:3000/dev and select **Create admin user**.
This will create a user: **a**, password: **a**)

### Configure your environment
All the configurations are set in the config file in the `/config` folder.

To override this configurations to match your development environment:

1. Create a file named `/config/local-evelopment.json`
2. Open the file and copy all the settings you wish to override from `/config/default.json`

**Notes**:

* You only need to copy the settings you need to override, not all the settings.
* The file format should be the same as `/config/default.json`


## Development

### Architecture

### Setting your IDE

#### Intellij

The source files include an Intellij/WebStorm project file. You can install get the [community version of IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition) for free and open the project.

It will provide you with:

* Syntax highlighting
* Code completion and navigation
* Built-in GIT interface
* Running and debugging of the server from the IDE
* Database browser and SQL shell
* and more...

#### IntelliJ recommended plugins
This plugins will add syntax highlighting and IDE integration.

* .ignore
* Jade
* Markdown Navigator
* NodeJS

#### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a free IDE from Microsoft that is making an attempt to compete with all the other cool kids and does a decent job. It has everything you need for Node.js development. Get it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com) and follow this [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/runtimes/nodejs) to set it up for Node.js.

### Branching and patching
while working on new features/patch you should branch out master using
```
$ git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>
```
It is recommended that your `<BRANCH_NAME>` will start with your name and short description of the your changes. For example example: `nate_updating_readme_file`

after writing some awesome code on your new shiny branch, you should `commit` changes and `merge` with origin/master, to do that use:

```
$ git commit -am "<COMMIT_MSG>"
$ git checkout master && git pull origin master
$ git checkout <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME> && git push origin <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
```

Note:

1. To push your branch you will need to first [create an account on JIRA](http://jira.midburn.org:7990/signup).
2. Push your branch via the above snippet
3. [Send a pull request](http://jira.midburn.org:7990/projects/SPARK/repos/spark/pull-requests).

### Localization
We use the **i18next** internationalization library for multi-language support.
The strings are stored in the `/locales` folder. The file name is the language code.

#### Tips:

1. Try to make the Hebrew text gender neutral. If you need to differentiate between genders, use the `_male` or `_female` suffixes.
2. Use variables in the text if needed, don't concatenate strings.
3. i18next supports many string operations including formatting, single/plural forms and more. Take a look at [i18next documentation](http://i18next.com/translate/).

### Templates
We use Jade template engine, a language that compiles to HTML, to seperate logic from markup. No more angle brackets!

#### i18n & templates
=======
#### I18N & Templates
>>>>>>> master
You can use i18n in Jade templates. To set an HTML element with a translatable data the general syntax is:
```
HTML_ELEMENT=t('KEY')
```
Example:
```
h1=t('welcome_spark')
```
Text injection inside attributes:
```
#{t('KEY')}
```
Example:
```
input( data-error="#{t('bad_email')}" )
```

### Email
Spark emails by default are **not being sent**. If you wish the emails from Spark to go through, set the `enable` property in your **local** config file.

```javascript
  "mail": {
	"enabled": true,
  },
```
