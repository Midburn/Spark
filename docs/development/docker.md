# Using Spark with Docker

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Build the images

```
docker-compose build
```

Start the environment

```
docker-compose up
```

Spark should be available at http://localhost:3000

See the [Docker Compose Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/) for more details about this environment.
