# Using Spark with Docker

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Start the environment

```
docker-compose up
```

Spark should be available at http://localhost:3000

You can log in to the populated DB using user `admin@midburn.org` and password `admin`.

See the [Docker Compose Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/) for more details about how to use this environment.
